I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Physics at Harvard University in the Hekstra lab. For my graduate research I am studying how heterogeneity develops in populations of yeast when exposed to environmental stressors. As part of that work I have developed Python code to control a custom microscope and laser setup in order to automate the highthroughput collection of single cell raman spectra in concert with traditional microscopy. I have also been developing a state of the art microscopy data analysis pipeline for segmenting, tracking, and analyzing cells over a time series of images. 
 
 I have also taught several [Scientific python bootcamps](https://github.com/Hekstra-Lab/scientific-python-bootcamp) for undergraduates as well as [a workshop](https://github.com/Hekstra-Lab/nesm-python) for the New England Society of Microscopy.

 In my spare time I enjoy gardening, fixing bikes, and running. I also contribute to several open source Python projects which you can read about below.
